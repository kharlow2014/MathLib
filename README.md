# MathLib
A C# Math Library. 
The purpose of this project is to create a library of various mathematical tools used for various tasks. 
I'm currently working on a class to handle matrices including functions for: multiplication, addition, finding the determinant, taking the LU decomposition, and more. 
The functions for addition, multiplication and finding the determinant are functional. 
The LU decomposition function is still a work in progress and using the LU decomposition to find the determinant will be functional as soon as I find the logical errors in my LU decomposition function.
